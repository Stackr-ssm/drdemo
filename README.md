Welcome to the Deal Review AI Framework – your sales team's new secret weapon for turning storytime into closetime.

Built using CrewAI and powered by a crew of expert agents fluent in the language of sales methodologies like Command of the Message, Challenger, SPIN, MEDDPICC, and others, this framework brings structure, insight, and actual progress to your deal reviews.

No more aimless “How’s it going?” meetings. No more managers playing psychic. No more reps narrating epic sagas that somehow end with, “We’ll circle back after the quarter.”

The Deal Review AI Framework equips sales reps with personalized guidance and prepares managers with actionable insight — before they even show up to the call. Think of it as having your own team of AI coaches who don’t sleep, don’t forget, and definitely don’t confuse activity with progress.
